### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

HI,

I'm Alessandro, I live in Italy in a small village bordering [Vineyard Landscape of Piedmont: Langhe-Roero and Monferrato](https://www.paesaggivitivinicoli.it/en) where I live with my family: my wife Silvia and my daughter Olivia.

I escaped from a big city showing some mild symptoms of misanthropy, but I am generally harmless.

I'm an object oriented software design and programming consultant. Mostly writing in Ruby, but expereinced on a range of the so-called _stack_.

The only social network I frequent is https://ruby.social, where you could possibly reach me.
